The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard which pulled from a dataset of ICC cricket batsmen and dynamically display an updated bio for each player.

Constructed from Python, HTML, and Javascript elements. Combines back-end database queries through PostGres and SQLACHEMY with a web-scraping element implemented into a Flask application. Front-end display handled with HTML & Bootstrap with interactive D3 JS scripts.
