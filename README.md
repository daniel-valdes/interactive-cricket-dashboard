# Interactive Cricket Dashboard
An interactive dashboard which pulls from a dataset of ICC cricket batsmen and displays an updated bio for each player. Constructed from Python, HTML, and Javascript elements. Combines back-end database queries through PostGres and SQLACHEMY with a web-scraping element implemented into a Flask application. Front-end display handled with HTML & Bootstrap with interactive D3 JS scripts.
